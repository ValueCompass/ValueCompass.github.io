Xing Xie is a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Asia and a pioneer in the field of spatial data mining. Dedicated to ensuring the responsible and value-aligned use of artificial intelligence, his team focuses on the research direction of "Societal AI". This approach aims to guarantee the fairness, reliability and safety, privacy protection, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability of technology and large model applications.

Their efforts include designing effective privacy protection methods to safeguard data used for training or fine-tuning large models and developing easy-to-understand explanation methods to help users understand how large models operate. They also work on mitigating or eliminating inherent social biases and harmful content in training data, making large models safer and more robust in dynamic environments.
