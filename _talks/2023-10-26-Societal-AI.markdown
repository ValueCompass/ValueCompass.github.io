The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is having an ever-increasing impact on human society. To ensure AI becomes a technology that is socially responsible, we have chosen "Societal AI" as our research direction, collaborating across disciplines with social sciences such as psychology, sociology, and law. Our goal is to explore how AI can understand and adhere to the mainstream values of human society, make decisions that align with human expectations, and enable people to accurately assess the true value orientations and intelligence levels of AI through more robust evaluation models.
